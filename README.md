# food-waste-app
## Project's idea:
Food waste is a major issue in the UAE, with 3.27 million tonnes wasted annually, costing $3.5 billion.

feedr tackles this by turning surplus food into an opportunity. This online marketplace connects businesses with excess food to budget-conscious consumers. Restaurants and supermarkets list surplus items in real-time, with dynamic pricing and optimized delivery through Talabatâ€™s API and Google Maps. A reputation system encourages waste-conscious practices, while gamification rewards sustainable choices. By leveraging technology and community engagement, feedr aims to cut food waste and promote sustainability in the UAE.

2. Real-Time Food Listing System with Talabat API Integration
3. Dynamic Pricing Algorithm for Subsidized Food Items
4. Secure Payment Processing System
